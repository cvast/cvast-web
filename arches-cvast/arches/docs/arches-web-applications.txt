Arches Web Applications
#######################

Arches was designed from the ground up to be built upon and extended.  In fact, applications built on top of Arches can they themselves be built upon. `HistoricPlacesLA.org <http://historicplacesla.org>`_ is a good example of this.

Think of Arches as a strong foundation onto which you can build your own Arches powered web application.  Arches abstracts the low level details of managing your data and allows you to focus on building an application tailored to your needs.  

Out of the box, Arches provides the functionality to store, index, and search (temporally, spatially, and free text) any data entered into the system and to present it on a map or in tabular search results.  If you only need to read data out of the system then you're ready to go.  

Arches ends at the point of data entry and reporting.  If you need that level of functionality then you'll need to build that into your own application.  See the `Arches-Hip <http://arches-hip.readthedocs.org/en/latest/>`_ application for an example of an application built on top of Arches.



Architecture
============
Arches is comprised of 4 basic components.

#.  A `django <https://www.djangoproject.com/>`_ based server tier written in `python <https://www.python.org/>`_ 
#.  A `bootstrap <http://getbootstrap.com/>`_ based UI using a combination of javascript and css
#.  A spatially enabled `postgres <http://www.postgresql.org/>`_ database
#.  An `elasticsearch <https://www.elastic.co/>`_ search engine 

Internally, Arches uses a REST based api to transfer data back and forth between the UI and the server and between the server and the elasticsearch service.

Arches is a multi-page application.  The pages are a hybrid of traditional `django templates <https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.6/topics/templates/>`_ and `backbone <http://backbonejs.org/>`_ views.  Each page will typically have a template called my_template.htm and a matching backbone view called my_template.js

For Example::

    arches
        app
            templates
            ..my_template.htm

    arches
        app
            media
                js
                ..my_template.js
