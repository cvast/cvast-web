                    <p>Dr. Jen Bright (Assistant Professor, Geosciences) has a PhD in functional morphology from the University
                        of Bristol, and a MGeol from the University of Leeds. She was most recently an ERC Postdoctoral Research
                        Assistant University of Sheffield; Project Title “Understanding evolutionary rates on the Tree of
                        Life in time and space." She is the author or co-author on 10 major publications in journals such
                        as the Journal of Anatomy, Biology Letters, and the Journal of Paleontology. What made Jen a premier
                        candidate for this position is her work in crowd-sourcing digital analyses and her pioneering work
                        in Finite Element Analysis for paleontology and evolutionary anatomy. Using laser scans of bird beaks
                        and other data, she has participated in the transformation of digital paleontology. </p>
                    <p>As part of a team, she has led the morphometrics component of the research to collect and landmark white-
                        and blue-light surface scans (FlexScan3D) of the beak of every bird species, obtained from museum
                        collections. The immense number of specimens involved led her to develop a crowdsourcing website
                        (www.markmybird.org), allowing the public to participate in data collection and interact with the
                        research. The site has been hugely successful, and in the months since its launch, they have registered
                        over 600 users who have marked more than 7,000 specimens between them. The data collected is being
                        used to investigate macroevolutionary patterns by mapping the morphometric data on to a phylogenetic
                        tree.
                    </p>
                    <p>Using a combination of Finite Element Analysis and Geometric Morphometrics methods, she is conducting
                        research to discern which aspects of form are under biomechanical, phylogenetic, or developmental
                        control, to give greater confidence in our ability to understand the ecological role and behavior
                        of extinct taxa known solely from their skeletal form. This permits detailed questions about the
                        nature of faunal changes through time. Although her primary interests concern bird skulls, the methods
                        she uses are easily transferable to other taxa or non-biological objects and systems.

                    <p>Dr. Rachel Opitz (Assistant Professor, Anthropology) began her archaeological career in Europe, completing
                        a PhD at Cambridge and then working as a post- doctoral researcher in France (Besançon). She went
                        to the University of Arkansas through the Digital Institute for Archaeology in 2011 as a post-doctoral
                        fellow and then returned to Europe in 2012 to continue her research, taking up post-doctoral fellowships
                        in Slovenia and France in 2012-2013 in connection with ongoing projects in the forests of eastern
                        France. She then returned to the University of Arkansas in the role of Executive Director of the
                        SPARC Program, CAST’s NSF-funded effort to develop a national center for research in spatial archaeometry.
                        This year, in addition to continuing to manage the SPARC Program, and she was serving as a Visiting
                        Assistant Professor in Anthropology. </p>
                    <p>Rachel has an active research program focused on rural western Mediterranean societies and landscapes
                        in the 1st millennium BCE, a strong track record in publication with a book contract in hand and
                        a dozen peer reviewed articles, ongoing engagement in the direction of a two research programs -
                        SPARC and the Gabii Project - and experience teaching and mentoring students at the undergraduate
                        and graduate level. Her research investigates how different rural communities are operating within
                        this increasingly interconnected world. The foundations of this work are in remote sensing and survey,
                        human perception of the built and natural environment as studied through formal exercises in 3D modeling
                        and analysis of visual attention of users of the models, and the material culture of rural communities
                        and the small towns emerging within them. The themes of her research cut across regional divides,
                        providing natural links to the research and teaching of colleagues.
                    </p>
                    <p>She has an active research project in eastern France, carrying out multi-method survey in the Forêt de
                        Chailluz in the Franche-Comté and she is associated with comparative projects in the Forêt de Haye
                        (Lorraine) and Nages (Languedoc). Through this project (Project LIEPPEC) she is applying a multi-method
                        approach to understand the changing dynamics of the area which is now within and immediately around
                        the Forêt de Chailluz, integrating airborne lidar, geophysical prospection, palynology, archival
                        and documentary evidence, metal-detector prospection and limited coring. Perfect for CVAST, she has
                        recognized expertise in photogrammetric modeling in the context of excavations, LIDAR applications
                        to sites and landscapes, and in developing information metrics to assess the appropriateness of 3D
                        data for different types of archaeological interpretation. She is also invested in the application
                        of perceptual saliency metrics for investigating the way humans visually perceive the basic elements
                        of their surroundings, with important implications for the organization of space in built-up areas
                        and the placement of structures and markers in landscapes.
                    </p>
                    <p>She has developed a strong international research network, notably as the chair of the Aerial Archaeology

                    <p>Dr. Ryan Carney (Assistant Professor, Integrative Biology) has two bachelor’s degrees from UC Berkeley,
                        one in Integrative Biology and one in Art. He has a both a MPH and an MBA from Yale in health and
                        technology. He has a MS and PhD from Brown University in Ecology and Evolutionary Biology. As a National
                        Geographic Explorer, and with papers published as a graduate student in Nature, Nature Communications,
                        Paleontology, Scientific Reports (Nature), and multiple papers in Emerging Infectious Diseases, he
                        is already established. He has over 600 citations as a graduate student.</p>
                    <p>At Yale, Ryan created the most successful and most cited geospatial predictive model for anticipating
                        the spread of dengue favor, a mosquito born virus. This research effort will be key to modeling and
                        managing the spread of the Zika virus in Florida and Dr. Carney’s skills are already in demand for
                        this work.
                    </p>
                    <p>At Brown University, Ryan primarily studied the evolution of flight and locomotion. He studies the structural
                        and functional changes that occurred during major locomotor transitions, as well as the evolution
                        and function of coloration over deep time. His interdisciplinary research program combined leading-edge
                        digital and molecular technologies, exceptional fossil specimens, and novel comparative approaches
                        among living and extinct animals. His work aims to reveal overarching evolutionary processes that
                        have driven adaptive radiations, and answer fundamental questions in organismal biology. He also
                        brings a diverse background and over a decade of leadership experience serving as Principal Investigator
                        for various large-scale research projects. As a paleontologist and evolutionary anatomist, his research

                    <p>Matthew Vincent is a Research Associate in CVAST and manager of our European operations. He is based
                        at the Bruno Kessler Foundation in Trento, Italy. He has been digging in the dirt since 2004 when
                        he got his first taste of archaeology in Jordan. It wasn’t long after that Matthew began mixing another
                        passion into archaeology: technology. Beginning with a focus on GIS in archaeology, he then began
                        to work on field recording, photogrammetry, laser scanning, and immersive visualization systems.
                        In 2014 Matthew joined the Initial Training Network for Digital Cultural Heritage, a Marie Sklowdowska-Curie
                        Actions program focused on holistic approaches to cultural heritage using advanced technology. In
                        2015, Matthew founded Rekrei (formerly Project Mosul) with fellow researcher Chance Coughenour. As
                        part of CVAST, Matthew will focus on the European projects, helping to coordinate those while also
                        working on continued research in crowdsourcing lost heritage through Rekrei, cultural heritage data
                        platforms related to CVAST work in Europe, streamlining data acquisition and processing, and innovative
                        forms of 3D data dissemination. His specializations include: photogrammetry, databases, archaeology,
                        3D acquisition, drones, web-based applications, mobile applications, crowdsourcing, and public archaeology.
                        He has a BA Theology & Biblical Languages from Walla Walla University, 2004; MA Anthropological Archaeology
                        from University of California, San Diego, 2013 (NSF IGERT Fellow); PhD Candidate at the University
                        of Murcia in the program of History, Geography and Art History: Society, Territory, and Culture -
                        Fall 2016. He is currently leading a number of projects in Jordan.
