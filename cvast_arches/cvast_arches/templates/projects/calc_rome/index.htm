                    Mogetta at the University of Missouri and Laura Banducci at Carleton University to investigate traces
                    of past use seen on Black Gloss ceramics from the Sala V collection of Rome’s Capitoline Museum.</p>
                <p> Black gloss pottery was made in central and southern Italy from the late 4th century BCE through to the middle
                    of the 1st century BCE and plays an important role in our understanding of the consumption of food and
                    drink both every day and on special occasions. The objects in the Sala V collection, normally in storage
                    and not accessible by the public, have never been studied.

                    in the Roman world, and the Roman economy in general? Is there a correlation between the quality of the
                    table wares and the level of use wear? Were imported objects used differently than the locally made ones?

                <p>To address these questions, our team has been carrying out 3D scanning to capture detailed surface models
                    of the objects. These models are now being analysed to assess the types and extent of wear and marks
                    of use on their interior and exterior surfaces. These marks might indicate things that happened during
                    the production process, during the active use of the object, or after its deposit in a grave or sanctuary.
                    Differentiating between these types of wear is crucial, as is identifying further specific traces of
                    different types of wear that can be linked to actions like cutting up food or stirring liquids.

                <p>In the first stage of the project we are developing metrics to differentiate between areas dominated by specific
                    types of wear, e.g. scratches made by a sharp narrow tool vs. broad shallow abrasions, with promising
                    initial results. Current research is focused on developing new ways to measure and quantify these different
                    types of wear, so that analyses can be performed across large datasets and more consistent assessment
                    of the extent and type of use- wear can be made.
