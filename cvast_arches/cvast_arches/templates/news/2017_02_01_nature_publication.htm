                    <p>
                        Dr. Bright recently joined USFâ€™s faculty as an assistant professor in the
                        <a href="https://www.facebook.com/USFGeosciences/" target="_blank">USF School of Geosciences</a>                        and is a member of CVAST. Together with a team of researchers she studied the evolution of birds
                        through a remarkable crowdsourced science effort, Mark My Bird. While at
                        <a href="https://www.facebook.com/theuniversityofsheffield/" target="_blank">The University of Sheffield</a>,
                        Bright worked to scan and document thousands of birds at the
                        <a href="http://www.nature.com/" target="_blank">Natural History Museum, London</a> and worked with
                        citizen scientists from around the world to collect wider samples and data.
