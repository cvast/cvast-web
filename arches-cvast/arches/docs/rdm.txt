Reference Data Manager (RDM)
############################

The Arches Reference Data Management (RDM) tool is a core Arches module which enables the creation and maintenance of controlled vocabularies for use in dropdowns and controlled fields within the various Arches Resource forms.

The use of the RDM is restricted to the Reference Data Manager, the person responsible for maintaining the controlled vocabularies. It allows for the creation, update, amendment and deletion of concept schemes (controlled vocabularies). In addition the RDM enables you to export your schemes as SKOS-Compliant XML files as well as the import of external thesauri. For more information on SKOS see http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/.

Concept Schemes
---------------
A concept scheme can be viewed as an aggregation of one or more concepts and the semantic relationships (links) between those concepts. 

Each controlled vocabulary within the Arches RDM, whether it is a simple wordlist or a polyhierarchical thesaurus, is defined as a concept scheme. [More detail about concept schemes needed here]

**Adding a new concept scheme**
``````````````````````````````` 
1. In the left hand panel select  **Add Scheme** from the **Tools** dropdown. The *Add Concept Scheme* pop-up will appear.
2.  Insert the title [Test Scheme] of the new concept scheme in the *ConceptScheme Name* field.
3. Add a brief description of the Concept Scheme in the *Scope Note* field.
4. Select the language of the ConceptScheme by clicking in the '**Language**' field. This currently defaults to *en-(US) (English)*
5. Click the **Save Changes** button. The new concept scheme will appear in the **ConceptSchemes** panel.

Adding a label to a scheme
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
It is possible to add multiple labels to a scheme. This is useful as some schemes may have been referred to by different names previously.

1. Select the **Test Scheme** from the left hand **RDM** panel. The *Test Scheme* will appear in the right hand panel.
2. Select **Add Label**. The *Add Concept Label* pop-up will appear.
3. Click in the field marked '**prefLabel**'. The list of label types will appear.
4. Select the label type.
5. Select the language of the label by clicking in the *Language* field. This currently defaults to *en-(US) (English)*
6. Click the **Save** button. The new label will appear in the **Labels** panel.

Adding a note to a scheme
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
It is possible to add multiple notes to a scheme. This allows the reference data manager to add more information regarding the scheme including the scope of what it covers, it's definition, changes to the history of the scheme, and how it should be used.

1. Select **Add Note**. The *Add Concept Note* pop-up will appear.
2. Enter the text for the new note in the '**Note Editor**' field. 
3. Click in the field marked '**scopeNote**'. The list of Note types will appear.
4. Select the relevant Note type. 
        **NB** Only one note of each type is allowed.
5. Select the language of the Note by clicking in the '**Language**' field. This currently defaults to *en-(US) (English)*
6. Click the **Save** button. The new Note will appear in the **Notes** panel.

**Building the Scheme**
```````````````````````
Having created the new scheme you should now add the Top Concepts. These will form the framework for the vocabulary and act as the parents for more detailed concepts. This multi-level construction is known as the hierarchy. In a simple wordlist there will by only one level of concepts but in a complex thesaurus the hierarchy can be many levels deep.

Adding a Top Concept to a scheme
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
1. In the Right hand panel select  **Add Top Concept** from the **Manage** dropdown. The *Add Concept* pop-up will appear.
2. Enter the text for the label in the '**Label**' field. 
3. Enter the definition of the concept in the **Note**' field. The list of Note types will appear.
4. Select the language of the Note by clicking in the '**Language**' field. This currently defaults to *en-(US) (English)*
5. Select  *hasTopConcept* from the '**Relation from Parent**' field. 
6. Click the **Save Changes** button. The new concept will appear in the **Broader/Narrower Concepts** panel.

It may be that other concept schemes similar to the one you are developing may already exist. If this is the case it is possible to import concepts along with their attributes from an external source. By default the RDM can import concepts from the Getty Art and Architecture Thesaurus

Importing a Top Concept from an external scheme
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
1. In the Right hand panel select  **Import Top Concept from SPARQL** from the **Manage** dropdown. The *Import Concept* pop-up will appear.
2. Select **Getty AAT** from the list of **Schemes** available.
3. In the '**Search for a concept**' field type the text of a concept, eg. houses. A selection of concepts matching the text will appear.
4. Select the appropriate concept. The *Concept Identifier* field will be populated with the URI of the concept.
5. Click the **Import** button. The new concept will appear in the **Broader/Narrower Concepts** panel.
6. Click on the concept. The Concept details panel will appear and the **Notes** panel will be populated with the external concept's *scopeNote*

Adding a child concept
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
1. Select the concept, which will act as the parent for the new child concept, by clicking on it. The Concept details panel will appear
2. In the Right hand panel select  **Add Child** from the **Manage** dropdown. The *Add Concept* pop-up will appear.
3. Enter the text for the label in the '**Label**' field. 
4. Enter the definition of the concept in the **Note**' field. The list of Note types will appear.
5. Select the language of the Note by clicking in the '**Language**' field. This currently defaults to *en-(US) (English)*
6. Select  *narrower* from the '**Relation from Parent**' field. 
7. Click the **Save Changes** button. The new concept will appear in the **Broader/Narrower Concepts** panel.
8. Click on the new concept. The Concept details panel will appear and the **Notes** panel will be populated with the concept's *scopeNote*

Importing a child concept
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
1. Select the concept, which will act as the parent for the new child concept, by clicking on it. The Concept details panel will appear.
2. In the Right hand panel select  **Import Child from SPARQL** from the **Manage** dropdown. The *Import Concept* pop-up will appear.
3. Select **Getty AAT** from the list of **Schemes** available.
4. In the '**Search for a concept**' field type the text of a concept, eg. castle. A selection of concepts matching the text will appear.
5. Select the appropriate concept. The *Concept Identifier* field will be populated with the URI of the concept.
6. Click the **Import** button. The new concept will appear in the **Broader/Narrower Concepts** panel.
7. Click on the concept. The Concept details panel will appear and the **Notes** panel will be populated with the external concept's *scopeNote*

Adding an additional Parent Concept (polyhierarchy)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Some concepts may have more than one parent for example a castle is a type of fortification but it is also a domestic building. This situation where there are more than one possible parent concepts is called polyhierarchy. 

1. Select the concept, which you want to add a parent concept to, by clicking on it.
2. Select  **Manage Parents** from the **Manage** dropdown. The *New Parent Concept* pop-up will appear.
3. In the '**Search for a concept**' field type the text of the parent concept you are going to add, eg. domestic buildings. A selection of concepts matching the text will appear.
4. Select the appropriate concept. 

Browsing the Scheme using the graph interface
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
For any Concept the *Broader/Narrower Concepts* panel defaults to the tree view and shows a concept's immediate broader (parent) and narrower (child) concepts. The scheme may also be browsed using the graph interface.

1. In the Broader/Narrower Concepts panel click **Show graph**. The graph view will appear centred on the concept you have chosen. 
2. Navigate the graph by clicking on the 'nodes' (the circles). Clicking on a node will bring up a dialog box with the concept label and a 'x' symbol. 
3. Click on the label to jump to the details for a concept

Adding a Related Concept
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
As part of a thesaurus it is possible to relate concepts which are not hierarchically related but may be of interest to a user. This 'Associative' relationship can be made by relating one concept to many others.

1. In the Right hand panel click on **Add Related Concept** in the *Related Concepts* panel. The *Manage Related Concepts* pop-up will appear.
2. Enter the text for the related concept in the '**Select a concept**' field. A selection of concepts matching the text will appear.
3. Select the appropriate concept.
4. Click in the **Relation type** field. The Relation Type dropdown will appear.
5. Select '**Related**'.
6. Click the **Save** button. The related term is added to the concept.

Adding an image to a concept
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Searching for a concept
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^


Deleting a concept
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Deleting a concept is simple in Arches but car should be taken that the concept has not been used in any recording forms. If a concept has been used a warning message will appear informing the Reference Data Manager that all instances of the concept in use must be replaced with an alternative concept before the concept can be deleted. If the Reference Data Manager is certain the concept has not been used then the concept may be deleted using either of the following methods.

Method 1: Tree view
"""""""""""""""""""
1. Identify the concept's parent concept and bring up its details.
2. In the *Broader/Narrower Concepts* panel make sure the tree view is visible (This is the default view).
3. Click on the '**x**' symbol next to the concept to be deleted. The *Delete a Concept* pop-up will appear.

    **NB** A warning message 'By deleting this concept, you will also be deleting the following concepts as well. This operation cannot be undone.' will appear. If you do not want to delete the concept click the **No** button.

4. Click the **Yes** button. The concept is deleted (along with any of its children).

Method 2: Graph view
